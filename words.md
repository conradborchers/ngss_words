## Dimensions

1. Patterns. Observed patterns of forms and events guide organization and
classification, and they prompt questions about relationships and the factors
that influence them.

2. Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation. Events have causes,
sometimes simple, sometimes multifaceted. A major activity of science
is investigating and explaining causal relationships and the mechanisms
by which they are mediated. Such mechanisms can then be tested across
given contexts and used to predict and explain events in new contexts.

3. Scale, proportion, and quantity. In considering phenomena, it is critical
to recognize what is relevant at different measures of size, time, and energy
and to recognize how changes in scale, proportion, or quantity affect
a system’s structure or performance.

4. Systems and system models. Defining the system under study—specifying
its boundaries and making explicit a model of that system—provides
tools for understanding and testing ideas that are applicable throughout
science and engineering.

5. Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation. Tracking fluxes of
energy and matter into, out of, and within systems helps one understand
the systems’ possibilities and limitations.

6. Structure and function. The way in which an object or living thing is
shaped and its substructure determine many of its properties and
functions.

7. Stability and change. For natural and built systems alike, conditions of
stability and determinants of rates of change or evolution of a system are
critical elements of study.

# TODO

### July 31st

* extracting interesting words and abbreviations from most common words
* and improving "common words" script (twitter terms, word stem, punctuation, caps, ...)

* finish lists of words for categories

* finalize search script for adding searches to data frame

###

* aggregate multiple columns to categories

* explore most common words and abbreviations

* explore data set for tentative words

* improve and validate regex search

* add more descriptives
